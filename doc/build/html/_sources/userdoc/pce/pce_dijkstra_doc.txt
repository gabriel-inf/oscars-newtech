.. _pce_dijkstra:

Dijkstra PCE Module
===================

This module is one of the fundamental pathfinding elements of the PCE, used to compute shortest (least-cost) path routing on a constrained network. Dijsktra's Algorithm_ is one of the most widely adopted routing algorithms because it optimally computes its path. Most of the service-specific PCE modules rely on the Dijkstra PCE for the low-level path computation after constraining the topology for their specified services.
